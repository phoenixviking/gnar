Welcome to GNAR

The obstacle avoidance game is based on a movie about a game in extreme skiing, called "GNAR"; it features a point system that rewards players for the most daunting (definitely life-threatening), comedic, and performative jumps and lines.

Instructions to run the game:
1. Run <run.py>
2. Enjoy!

Below is a link to the film if you are interested in seeing the silly culture around GNAR (although the video from the official site is often taken down):

Otherwise please take 2 minutes to watch Shane McConkey, the skier the movie is a homage to, absolutely sending it off a cliff:
